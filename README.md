# Git lesson

This lesson cover the basics of using git for version control.

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE bootcamp.

This is my first trial of git by my own.

## Adding Features
Features should be developed on branches. To create and switch to a branch, use the command 'git switch -c new_branch_name'

To switch to an existing branch, use 'git switch branch_name'

I added gitignore to the repository.
